I built this simple web application with React and Redux. The general purpose of this project was to demonstrate my skills and style, but another reason was to try some technologies I never or rarely used in my everyday work or some things I've never done before. For this purpose, I decided not to use Create-React-App, and create my custom webpack build.

When I started making this app, it should have had a built-in calendar, but later I decided to publish it in NPM as a separate package. That was another new experience for me.
